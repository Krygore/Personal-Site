                <h2 class="background-header">My Background</h2>
                <p> Born and raised in Washington State USA, graduated from high school in 2014 and dove head first into a career in physical labor working landscaping and excavation! After 7 years, my body couldn't take the abuse anymore, so I decided to expand my horizons and look towards technology...</p>
                <p> I began learning front end web development in February of 2021 through <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freecodecamp.org</a>, where I took a beginner level course in Responsive Web Design. From there, I used various learning platforms and resources such as <a href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3schools.com</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>, <a href="https://udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy.com</a> and more to further my education and start learning back-end development.</p>
                <p> Outside of technology, I also enjoy hobbies such as freshwater fish keeping and aquascaping as well as chainsaw carving.

                      <h3 class="subHeader">Fish Keeping</h3> 
                        <p> Fish keeping is something I got into about 2 years ago when I was in a pet store looking for a new dog food. I saw a really cool looking betta fish and decided I wanted to get it. I got a little 3.5 gallon aquarium kit, set it up, had the fish in it for a while and immediately had other ideas. A couple years later, I've got 3 tanks with over 50 fish, all tropical fish.</p>
                        <p> Aquascaping is a huge part of fish keeping. You get to design the layout and theme of the tank and, if you choose live plants like I have, you can literally watch it grow and flourish.</p>
                        <p> Some of the fish I have include, but are not limited to:</p>
                        <ul class="fklist">
                          <li>Betta Fish</li>
                          <li>Psuedomugal Rainbow Fish</li>
                          <li>Gouramis (Variety)</li>
                          <li>Tetras (Variety)</li>
                          <li>Barbs</li>
                          <li>Loaches (Variety)</li>
                        </ul>

                      <h3 class="subHeader">Chainsaw Carving</h3>
                      <p> I've always had a creative side. One day I was out cutting fire wood when I ran out of room in the truck and still had a couple logs left to cut. I picked one up, set it on top of another, and started cutting angles into the wood until a shape started to appear. After about 30 minutes of playing around, I had myself a little carving that was about 14 inches tall and 12 inches round. It wasn't perfect, but it was good enough to be recognized as a mushroom.</p>
                      <p> I became enthralled with the craft and watched hundreds of hours of youtube videos and looking at pictures of carvings on google and pintrest.</p>
                      <p> Since then, I have carved owls, wolves, dragons, fish, and even made a couple benches. In some cases, people have even asked me to carve them certain items for a commission!</p>
                      <p> To see some of my carvings and even some videos of me carving, check out <a href="#">this page</a>.</p>

                      <h3 class="subHeader">Other Hobbies</h3>
                      <p>  A few other things I enjoy doing in my past time is playing computer games, reading, and photography.</p>
                      <p> As far as gaming goes, I enjoy playing strategy, sci-fi, and RPG games like EVE Online, Neverwinter Nights, Elder Scrolls, Evony Free Forever, and more. Games that make you think about what course you want to take and that give you a sense of purpose in the game world.</p>
                      <p> My taste in reading material is similar to that of my gaming selection. I like science fiction/fantasy, historical, and adventerous. Books like The Inheritence Cycle, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Norse, Roman and Greek Mythologies, and many more that I could list, but don't have the time of day to do so...</p>
                      <p> Photography is really more my wife's thing, I just like setting up a good photo or finding a location to take photos of wildlife or scenary. When it comes to understanding the concept of shutter speed and all that, I'm at a loss. But I do know a little about photo editing to make an image appear slightly better!</p>
